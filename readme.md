Arrow will change the color from green to red depending on the wind strength and direction, i.e. tailwind is always good(green) and light headwind is not a big deal either (green), but stronger headwind will be shown in orange or red.

The windsock data field uses Garmin provided weather data, make sure it is enabled in the Garmin Connect Mobile for your Edge device.
